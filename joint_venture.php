                 <p >Dangers are not restricted to geographical factors yet incorporate political vulnerability, market slumps, advancement of new advances and social and ecological concerns, and – as we have seen for this present year – normal (or perhaps man-made) catastrophes like pandemics, still if the cooperation is there and a JV stands it serves the purpose of helping small scale mining groups. Elective financing exists – from sovereignty to gushing to offtake arrangements. Private value firms have likewise been putting all the more effectively in the area. </p>
                 
                 <p >However, in spite of these choices, many mining organizations stay capital-starved. This has prompted combination in the area, especially in the gold space, as organizations endeavour to acquire the weight they need to pull in financing and reinforce their presentation measurements, and to JVs as well.</p>
